Taiwan_Bot_Tournament_Threes-
=============================

These codes are used in Taiwan Bot Tournament for game Threes.

We don't have much time to refactor the code and make it look nice...

and in these files, TD learning codes are included!

To run the programs using our data trained by TD can be downloaded at http://aigames.nctu.edu.tw/~cgilab/download/
